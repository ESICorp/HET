# Enterprise Application Integration


***The Need for Integration***

Enterprises are typically comprised of hundreds if not thousands of applications that are custom-built, acquired from a third-party, part of a legacy system, or a combination thereof, operating in multiple tiers of different operating system platforms. It is not uncommon to find an enterprise that has 30 different Websites, three instances of SAP and countless departmental solutions.

We may be tempted to ask: How do businesses allow themselves to get into such a mess? Shouldn't any CIO of such an enterprise spaghetti architecture be fired? Well, like in most cases things happen for a reason.

First of all, writing business applications is hard. Creating a single, big application to run a complete business is next to impossible. The ERP vendors have had some success at creating larger-than-ever business applications. The reality, though, is that even the heavyweights like SAP, Oracle, Peoplesoft and the like only perform a fraction of the business functions required in a typical enterprise. We can see this easily by the fact that ERP systems are one of the most popular integration points in today's enterprises.

Second, spreading business functions across multiple applications provides the business with the flexibility to select the "best" accounting package, the "best" customer relationship management or the order processing system that best suits the business' needs. One-stop-shopping for enterprise applications is usually not what IT organizations are interested in, nor is possible given the number individual business requirements.

Vendors have learned to cater to this preference and offer focused applications around a specific core function. However, the ever-present urge to add new functionality to existing software packages has caused some functionality spillover amongst packaged business applications. For example, many billing systems started to incorporate customer care and accounting functionality. Likewise, the customer care software maker takes a stab at implementing simple billing functions such as disputes or adjustments. Defining a clear functional separation between systems is hard: is a customer disputing a bill considered a customer care or a billing function?

Users such as customers, business partners and internal users do generally not think about system boundaries when they interact with a business. They execute business functions, regardless of the how many internal systems the business function cuts across. For example, a customer may call to change his or her address and see whether the last payment was received. In many enterprises, this simple request can span across the customer care and billing systems. Likewise, a customer placing a new order may require the coordination of many systems. The business needs to validate the customer ID, verify the customer's good standing, check inventory, fulfill the order, get a shipping quote, compute sales tax, send a bill, etc. This process can easily span across five or six different systems. From the customer's perspective, it is a single business transaction.

In order to support common business processes and data sharing across applications, these applications need to be integrated. Application integration needs to provide efficient, reliable and secure data exchange between multiple enterprise applications.


***Integration Challenges***

* Enterprise integration requires a significant shift in corporate politics. Business applications generally focus on a specific functional area, such as Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Billing, Finance, etc. This seems to be an extension of Conway's famous law that postulates that "Organizations which design systems are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations." As a result, many IT groups are organized in alignment with these functional areas. Successful enterprise integration does not only need to establish communication between multiple computer systems but also between business units and IT departments -- in an integrated enterprise application groups no longer control a specific application because each application is now part of an overall flow of integrated applications and services.

* Because of their wide scope, integration efforts typically have far-reaching implications on the business. Once the processing of the most critical business functions is incorporated into an integration solution, the proper functioning of that solution becomes vital to the business. A failing or misbehaving integration solution can cost a business millions of Dollars in lost orders, misrouted payments and disgruntled customers.

* One important constraint of developing integration solutions is the limited amount of control the integration developers typically have over the participating applications. In most cases, the applications are "legacy" systems or packaged applications that cannot be changed just to be connected to an integration solution. This often leaves the integration developers in a situation where they have to make up for deficiencies or idiosyncrasies inside the applications or differences between the applications. Often it would be easier to implement part of the solution inside the application "endpoints", but for political or technical reasons that option may not be available.

* Despite the wide-spread need for integration solutions, only few standards have established themselves in this domain. The advent of XML, XSL and Web services certainly mark the most significant advance of standards-based features in an integration solution. However, the hype around Web services has also given grounds to new fragmentation of the marketplace, resulting in a flurry of new "extensions" and "interpretations" of the standards. This should remind us that the lack of interoperability between "standards-compliant" products was one of the major stumbling blocks for CORBA, which offered a sophisticated technical solution for system integration.

* Also, existing XML Web Services standards address only a fraction of the integration challenges. For example, the frequent claim that XML is the "Lingua franca" of system integration is somewhat misleading. Standardizing all data exchange to XML can be likened to writing all documents using a common alphabet, such as the Roman alphabet. Even though the alphabet is common, it is still being used to represent many languages and dialects, which cannot be readily understood by all readers. The same is true in enterprise integration. The existence of a common presentation (e.g. XML) does not imply common semantics. The notion of "account" can have many different semantics, connotations, constraints and assumptions in each participating system. Resolving semantic differences between systems proves to be a particularly difficult and time-consuming task because it involves significant business and technical decisions.

* While developing an EAI solution is challenging in itself, operating and maintaining such a solution can be even more daunting. The mix of technologies and the distributed nature of EAI solutions make deployment, monitoring, and trouble-shooting complex tasks that require a combination of skill sets. In many cases, these skill sets do not exist within IT operations or are spread across many different individuals.

Anyone who has been through an EAI deployment can attest to the fact that EAI solutions are a critical component of today's enterprise strategies, but make IT life harder, not easier. It's a long way between the high-level vision of the integrated enterprise (defined by terms such as "Straight-Through-Processing", "T+1", "Agile Enterprise") and the nuts-and-bolts implementations (what parameters did System.Messaging.XmlMessageFormatter take again?).


***How Integration Patterns Can Help***

There are no simple answers for enterprise integration. In our opinion, anyone who claims that integration is easy must be either incredibly smart (or at least a good bit smarter than the rest of us), incredibly ignorant (OK, let's say optimistic), or they have a financial interest in making you believe that integration is easy.

Even though integration is a broad and difficult topic, we can always observer some people who are much better at it than others. What do these people know that others don't? Since there is no such thing as "Teach Yourself Integration in 21 Days" (this book sure ain't!) it is unlikely that these people know all the answers to integration. However, these people have usually solved enough integration problems that they can compare new problems to prior problems they have solved. They know the "patterns" of problems and associated solutions. They learned these patterns over time by trial-and-error or from other experienced integration architects.

The "patterns" are not copy-paste code samples or shrink-wrap components, but rather nuggets of advice that describe solutions to frequently recurring problems. Used properly, the integration patterns can help fill the wide gap between the high-level vision of integration and the actual system implementation.
